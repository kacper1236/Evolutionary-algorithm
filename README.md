# Evolutionary-algorithm
Optimization function with evolutionary algorithm

Functions: 
1. Generalized Rosenbrock, field: [-30, 30]
2. Salomon, field: [-100, 100]
3. Whitley, field: [-10.24, 10.24]

# More optimizations
Add selections, crossover and mutate. I use multithreading for faster excecuting and giving answers.
